                <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
                <p> I have an idea; it’s an app for men to connect with other men who are at a similar stage in life, whether they’re struggling with their mental health, it’s the first time being a father, or they want some guidance, I'm also considering the idea of similar interests, to maybe encourage men to seek friendship when times are tough. I wish to create an app and an online platform that would be able to better support men by giving them access to people who may also be at the same stage in life or wanting to hang out.
                <p> The idea stems from an app I saw the other day called “Peanut-app”, which claims to “provide a safe place for women to talk and get support”, which I think is an excellent idea, but it is only for women. Therefore, my concept bloomed; I aim to provide men with a safe place to find support. My motivation would be myself; I was medically discharged from the army for mental health, and when I needed help, I realised that men specifically don’t have much support. We have the regular support networks, although being in the army, not everyone understands and can help, so I aim to implement a section within the app for ex-serving defence members to find others who have been through the same issue or are going through it and seeking support.
                <p> There is also a statistic that gives me the motivation that 12% of men last year were found to be experiencing a mental or behavioural condition. However, Australian men are still more vulnerable to suicide, making up 3 out of every four suicide-related deaths in Australia. A recent survey from the Bureau of Statistics 2020 found that Australian men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women, with over 2,500 suicide deaths recorded among males in 2020.
                <p>
                <p>
                <p>I will use “XCode”, which includes everything I need to develop, test, and distribute my app across all Apple platforms; I will also have to add a package that supports swift language. If I eventually need to launch the app on a different platform, I may have to investigate it further. However, I would consider using “android studio”, which will be a good option as it will provide tools for building my app to suit every type of android device; I will also require a java package added to android studio.
                <p>The hardest part I believe would be learning two completely different coding languages, as Apples XCode requires me to know Swift, which is Apples language for IOS, whereas Androids, Andriod Studio requires me to know Java. I will also have to learn two new terminals. However, I do believe that by accessing the thousands of online resources that will walk me through the process of navigating XCode, Android studio, learning Java and Swift step by step.
                <p>If the project is successful, I intend to make it accessible to men worldwide. I know saying that is a big thing; although the effects mental health has on men and women are drastic, it may not be a huge issue now, but once that person has been trying to deal with their problems for so long, there's only so much the human mind can take before having enough.
                <p>That’s why I intend on making it public, Intend on having a massive backlash due to some individual groups that may find the app offensive. However, there are apps that men cannot access because they are male. I am making this for the men who are ashamed to speak up to family and friends about their issues because they don’t understand and give them someone in a similar state of mind.
