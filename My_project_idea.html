                <h1>My Project Idea</h1>
                <p> I have an idea; it’s an app for men to connect with other men who are at a similar stage in life, whether they’re struggling with their mental health, it’s the first time being a father, or they want some guidance, I'm also considering the idea of similar interests, to maybe encourage men to seek friendship when times are tough. I wish to create an app and an online platform that would be able to better support men by giving them access to people who may also be at the same stage in life or wanting to hang out.
                <p> The idea stems from an app I saw the other day called “Peanut-app”, which claims to “provide a safe place for women to talk and get support”, which I think is an excellent idea, but it is only for women. Therefore, my concept bloomed; I aim to provide men with a safe place to find support. My motivation would be myself; I was medically discharged from the army for mental health, and when I needed help, I realised that men specifically don’t have much support. We have the regular support networks, although being in the army, not everyone understands and can help, so I aim to implement a section within the app for ex-serving defence members to find others who have been through the same issue or are going through it and seeking support.
                <p> There is also a statistic that gives me the motivation that 12% of men last year were found to be experiencing a mental or behavioural condition. However, Australian men are still more vulnerable to suicide, making up 3 out of every four suicide-related deaths in Australia. A recent survey from the Bureau of Statistics 2020 found that Australian men are three times more likely to die by suicide than women, with over 2,500 suicide deaths recorded among males in 2020.
                <p>My app would consist of a “dating app” style setup, following along the lines of Tinder - an app that inputs your preferences and location, so that you can match and connect to people who you might find attractive, interesting, or with the same line of thinking. On Tinder, the app also shows your interests on your profile. I wish to adopt both this feature and the swiping feature - as many other dating apps have used. Some other dating apps that have utilized the swiping figure include Bumble, Grindr and eHarmony.
                <p>These features would be used with both genders, not intended for a romantic connection. Instead, it would be used to connect people regardless, with the intent to make a genuine connection backed by similar interests in the profile. The users would pick out a maximum of 5 interests from a local pool. Whether the user is a first-time dad looking for support from other fathers, someone who has a mental illness - such as anxiety or depression - who just wants to not feel so alone, or discharged servicemen who left due to injury or illness, and want to find someone who can relate to their trauma, that's what this service can be used for. I will not allow bots or scam accounts to clutter the service, and make it a policy to perform a standard captcha test before you log into your account for the first time.
                <p>The best way I can think of to make sure the users of the site are genuine people, and not scams, bots or fakes is by implementing multifactor authentication, backed by photographic ID. If this is considered to be too invasive, or not possible for personal effects, we will find a safe way to authorise personal information from being leaked or spread. Otherwise, I can have an algorithm cross reference a photo they upload. In order to match two people that are more closely related, users would fill in a short questionnaire - no difference between each questionnaire. The answers - when it’s filled out - then match users with the same answers. I would also implement the ability to make group chats - similar to how Messenger allows you to add multiple people to a single chat, and remove them at will.
                <p>An extremely important function I plan on implementing is a “Need Help Now” function, that gives the phone number of your state's mental health hotline, and the location of the nearest mental and physical health service. It also sends a link to the eHeadspace website, if you don’t need crisis service but still need support. Things that I wish to avoid implementing is the idea of “You have a match!” This site isn’t meant to be seen like you’ve won a prize. I want this to be more like a genuine human connection, focused on interests and humanity, rather than a premium feature-locked paywall, that stops people from meeting organically. People should not be monetizable, nor should their relationships. Human connectivity and support services are the names of the game for my project. 
                <p>
                <p>I will use “XCode”, which includes everything I need to develop, test, and distribute my app across all Apple platforms; I will also have to add a package that supports swift language. If I eventually need to launch the app on a different platform, I may have to investigate it further. However, I would consider using “android studio”, which will be a good option as it will provide tools for building my app to suit every type of android device; I will also require a java package added to android studio.
                <p>The hardest part I believe would be learning two completely different coding languages, as Apples XCode requires me to know Swift, which is Apples language for IOS, whereas Androids, Andriod Studio requires me to know Java. I will also have to learn two new terminals. However, I do believe that by accessing the thousands of online resources that will walk me through the process of navigating XCode, Android studio, learning Java and Swift step by step.
                <p>If the project is successful, I intend to make it accessible to men worldwide. I know saying that is a big thing; although the effects mental health has on men and women are drastic, it may not be a huge issue now, but once that person has been trying to deal with their problems for so long, there's only so much the human mind can take before having enough.
                <p>That’s why I intend on making it public, Intend on having a massive backlash due to some individual groups that may find the app offensive. However, there are apps that men cannot access because they are male. I am making this for the men who are ashamed to speak up to family and friends about their issues because they don’t understand and give them someone in a similar state of mind.
