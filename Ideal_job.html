                <p>• Something like this would be a start of my IT career, and it is also in my current city. If I were to move back to Brisbane, I’d have a couple of better options, but this will get my foot in the door, and with my management knowledge and team skills, I’m sure to advance.
                <p>• Degree qualified in IT with a module in Cyber Security OR TAFE coursed in Cyber Security (highly regarded).
                <p>•	1-2 years experience in Cyber security (if you don’t have a degree) OR 1-2 years in Helpdesk with a proven passion / learning within Cyber.
                <p>•	I currently have teamwork and management skills; I also have practical written and verbal communication skills that would be needed for this role.
                <p>•	I plan to complete my bachelor's in IT and then further my knowledge by completing my cyber security course through RMIT afterwards.
